## Iron_NNPs
Modeling the potential energy surface of Fe(II) complexes. The respository is based on [the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Project](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp) and [EwaldMP](https://github.com/arthurkosmala/EwaldMP?tab=readme-ov-file). Please consider to cite their original work if you find this codebase is useful.
## Installation
